# PR-DC Arduino Library for Analog Devices AD7797

The AD7797 is a complete analog front end for high precision bridge sensor applications such as weigh scales. It contains a 24-bit sigma-delta (Σ-Δ) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The on-chip instrumentation amplifier has a fixed gain of 128, allowing small amplitude signals such as those from bridge sensors to be directly interfaced to the ADC.
